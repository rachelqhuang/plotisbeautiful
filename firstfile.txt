#datastructure:

Before doing any model work, we need to prepare for the data.
The usual data structure is a dataframe containing a bunch of numerical and categorical columns.

There is not baseline summarisation needed before plotting.

Plotting is extremely important to uncover the correlation and the trend of the data

Most common plots probably include: 
	histogram, scatterplot, time series etc

#qplot:

qplot() function can be used to create the most common graph types. While it does not expose ggplot's full power, it can create a very wide range of useful plots. The format is

	qplot(x, y, data=, color=, shape=, size=, alpha=, geom=, method=, formula=, facets=, xlim=, ylim= xlab=, ylab=, main=, sub=)

The explanation of the notations:

	x and y represent the x and y axis. For univariate data, like histogram, we dont need y because y will be count of the rows.

	alpha: transparency for overlapping elements expressed as a fraction between 0 (complete transparency) and 1 (complete opacity)

	Associates the levels of variable with symbol color, shape, or size. For line plots, color associates levels of a variable with line color. For density and box plots, fill associates fill colors with a variable. Legends are drawn automatically.
