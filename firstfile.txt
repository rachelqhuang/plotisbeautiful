#datastructure:

Before doing any model work, we need to prepare for the data.
The usual data structure is a dataframe containing a bunch of numerical and categorical columns.

iris dataset
the shape of the dataset is that each column will be one type of element, no transposed table, no horizontal shape
Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa
2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa
3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa
4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa

There is not baseline summarisation needed before plotting.

Plotting is extremely important to uncover the correlation and the trend of the data

Most common plots probably include: 
	histogram for distribution, bar chart for usual $ or quantity summarisation, grouped bar chart, scatterplot for correlation, time series for trend over time, boxplot for distribution etc

#qplot:

qplot() function can be used to create the most common graph types. While it does not expose ggplot's full power, it can create a very wide range of useful plots. The format is

	qplot(x, y, data=, color=, shape=, size=, alpha=, geom=, method=, formula=, facets=, xlim=, ylim= xlab=, ylab=, main=, sub=)

The explanation of the notations:

	x and y represent the horizontal and vertical axis. For univariate data, like histogram, we dont need y because y will be count of the rows.

	alpha: transparency for overlapping elements expressed as a fraction between 0 (complete transparency) and 1 (complete opacity)

	Associates the levels of variable with symbol color, shape, or size. For line plots, color associates levels of a variable with line color. For density and box plots, fill associates fill colors with a variable. Legends are drawn automatically.

	data: specifies a dataframe

	facets: Creates a trellis graph (multiple graphs on multiple panels rather than on one panel) by specifying conditioning variables. Its value is expressed as rowvar ~ colvar. To create trellis graphs based on a single conditioning variable, use rowvar~. or .~colvar).For example, sales by country, each graph will be one country

	geom: object shape of plot. The geom option is expressed as a character vector with one or more entries. geom values include "point", "smooth", "boxplot", "line", "histogram", "density", "bar", and "jitter".

	main & sub: Character vectors specifying the title and subtitle

	method & formula:
	If geom="smooth", a loess fit line and confidence limits are added by default. When the number of observations is greater than 1,000, a more efficient smoothing algorithm is employed. Methods include "lm" for regression, "gam" for generalized additive models, and "rlm" for robust regression. The formula parameter gives the form of the fit. 

	For example, to add simple linear regression lines, you'd specify geom="smooth", method="lm", formula=y~x. Changing the formula to y~poly(x,2) would produce a quadratic fit. Note that the formula uses the letters x and y, not the names of the variables. 

	For method="gam", be sure to load the mgcv package. For method="rml", load the MASS package

	xlab & ylab: character vector for x and y axis names

	xlim & ylim: two-element numeric vectors giving the minimum and maximum values for the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively
